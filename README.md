# Deploying with Webpack

## Introduction
This assignment demonstrates using a custom webpack configuration to build and run a basic React application that displays the local weather.

## Technologies Used
In addition to React and Express, this project manually leverages webpack for creating a build pipeline. 

## Getting Started
After cloning/forking the repository, you can run `yarn`/`npm install` to download all the related dependencies. To start the server and client, run `yarn start`. If you are using `npm`, make sure to edit the package.json file accordingly before running `npm start`. To create a new build, run `yarn build`/`npm run build`.

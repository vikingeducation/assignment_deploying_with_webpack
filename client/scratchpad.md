## Task 1

1. Create one (or more) React components that display the weather in your city.
2. Use `geolocation API` to get current city.
3. The default screen should display the weather in your city (explore the idea of using icons from the API, etc)
4. Use any design library you choose

## Task 2

1. Implement another component that displays a text box and a button. The user should be able to write a city name in the text box
2. Upon pressing the button, weather data will be fetched for that particular city and replace the UI

## Task 3

1. Deploy to Heroku!
